Small scripts for working with .po files

- `po_filter_strings` might come handy if your workflow makes deprecating certain strings a pain. E.g. in my case, localization is maintained in a single branch in a separate repository than the app being localized, and the app always pulls locale files from master. This made it really difficult to drop strings: you delete them from one branch, just for another branch to reintroduce them. `po_filter_strings` allows to remove unwanted strings from .po files, so if you hook it into your flow, you can ensure that these obsolete strings do not come back.
- `po_subtract` works similarly to `po_filter_strings`, except it takes the list of strings to remove from another .po file. In effect, it produces a set difference between two files (except the topmost comment with msgid '', which it always leaves intact). I wrote it because `pofilter` from Translate Toolkit allows filtering out fuzzy and untranslated strings from input file to output, but doesn't allow filtering out only good strings in similar fashion. `po_subtract` is a workaround for that issue: you can feed it your full .po file and a fuzzy/untranslated .po file, and it will produce a third .po file with only the translated strings for you.
